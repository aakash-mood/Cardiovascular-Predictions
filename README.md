# Cardiovascular Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

The number of cardiovascular ailments has reached
an all-time high in recent years. According to estimations, around
18 million deaths (32% fatalities) were caused by CVDs in 2019,
with heart attack and stroke deaths accounting for 85% of them.
Early detection and prevention are critical for the development of
successful health care. Machine learning has proven to be quite
beneficial in producing predictions and detecting anomalies. We
tested a range of cutting-edge models to predict the possibility of
heart illness, and we obtained results on which models performed
better and could be used to save many lives in the future.
